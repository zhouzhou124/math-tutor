description: Alias for /paperspine — starts the full PaperSpine workflow
---

Start the PaperSpine workflow for the current project.
This is an alias for `/paperspine` — follow the same logic below.

If `paper_rewriting_output/paper_spine_config.json` is missing or incomplete,
route to `paper-spine-ui` and launch the PaperSpine intake UI automatically.
Do not hand-write the configuration.

## Platform-specific launcher

### Windows

```powershell
$config = Join-Path (Get-Location) "paper_rewriting_output\paper_spine_config.json"
$launcher = Join-Path $env:USERPROFILE ".claude\skills\paper-spine-intake\scripts\launch_paperspine_ui.ps1"
if (-not (Test-Path -LiteralPath $launcher)) {
  throw "PaperSpine UI launcher not found at $launcher. Reinstall or resync PaperSpine."
}
if (-not (Test-Path -LiteralPath $config)) {
  powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File $launcher -OutputDir "paper_rewriting_output"
}
for ($i = 0; $i -lt 120 -and -not (Test-Path -LiteralPath $config); $i++) {
  Start-Sleep -Seconds 5
}
if (-not (Test-Path -LiteralPath $config)) {
  throw "PaperSpine intake config was not created yet. Finish the opened PowerShell UI window, then rerun /paperspine."
}
Get-Content -LiteralPath $config -Raw
```

### macOS / Linux

```bash
CONFIG="paper_rewriting_output/paper_spine_config.json"
LAUNCHER="$HOME/.claude/skills/paper-spine-intake/scripts/launch_paperspine_ui.sh"

if [ ! -f "$LAUNCHER" ]; then
  echo "PaperSpine UI launcher not found at $LAUNCHER. Reinstall or resync PaperSpine." >&2
  exit 1
fi

if [ ! -f "$CONFIG" ]; then
  chmod +x "$LAUNCHER"
  bash "$LAUNCHER" "paper_rewriting_output"
fi

for i in $(seq 1 120); do
  if [ -f "$CONFIG" ]; then break; fi
  sleep 5
done

if [ ! -f "$CONFIG" ]; then
  echo "PaperSpine intake config was not created yet. Finish the opened terminal window, then rerun /paperspine." >&2
  exit 1
fi

cat "$CONFIG"
```

## After config is ready

When the config already exists, read it directly and continue through the
`paper-spine` orchestrator workflow without relaunching intake unless required
fields are missing.
