| Row ID | Manuscript Unit | Current Problem or Planned Function | Motivation Link | Reference/SOTA Pattern Learned | Target Scene or Venue Norm | User Evidence or Citation Anchor | Planned Change/Text Move | Final Text Check |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| R0 | Whole-work framework and throughline | Establish the whole-work structure before drafting any section, so the document is not an append-only polish pass. | The confirmed motivation becomes the spine: every later unit must narrow, operationalize, test, or bound the same contribution rather than introduce parallel claims. | The reference/SOTA pattern learned is a problem-gap-design-evidence-limitation arc: strong examples first define what existing work cannot explain, then make the method choices look necessary, then let results answer the opening gap. | The target scene expects a visible architecture of claims, not isolated section summaries; journal, report, and competition norms all reward a line of reasoning that can be traced from opening problem to final implication. | Evidence anchors are source_map.md, evidence_bank.md, confirmed_motivation.md, and the available figures/tables/citations; no external reference contributes new user results. | Reframe the whole paper around motivation, method choice, evidence sequence, and bounded implication; sequence sections so each planned text move prepares the next one and creates front/back echo. | PASS: framework row controls all later rows, each section can point back to this throughline, and no final claim lacks an evidence anchor. |
| R1 | Executive summary or abstract opening move | State the problem and why the task matters before naming the method, because tool-first openings make the motivation look incidental. | The motivation is narrowed into a reader-facing problem statement that explains why the contribution is needed. | Reference examples use an unresolved task difficulty before method naming, so the abstract reads as an argument rather than an advertisement. | The target venue expects a concise contribution summary with problem, gap, method, evidence, and implication in a small space. | Anchors are confirmed_motivation.md, research_dossier.md, and headline user result claims. | Rewrite the opening as problem-gap-method-evidence, then place numbers only after the reader knows what question they answer. | PASS: final abstract opens with the problem, names evidence, and does not introduce unsupported claims. |
| R2 | Background or problem-restatement unit | Convert broad context into the specific gap the work addresses, instead of accumulating general background. | The motivation controls which background facts remain: only facts that make the central gap visible should stay. | SOTA gap mapping teaches the move of comparing prior limitations before presenting the new angle, avoiding empty novelty language. | The target scene expects the gap before design details, especially for journal and competition readers who need to see why the method exists. | Anchors are sota_gap_map.md, exemplar_learning_dossier.md, and citation keys already available to the manuscript. | Replace generic background with a staged setup: domain importance, unresolved limitation, consequence, and transition to the proposed contribution. | PASS: the gap appears before solution details and cites evidence or references. |
| R3 | Motivation-confirmation paragraph or problem thesis | Make the controlling motivation explicit after the gap, so the paper has one primary contribution rather than several equal slogans. | This row preserves the confirmed motivation as the central spine and prevents secondary method details from competing with it. | Strong reference papers often use a thesis paragraph that turns the literature gap into a testable writing contract for the rest of the paper. | The target scene norm is that readers should know what evidence the paper owes them before entering methods or models. | Anchors are confirmed_motivation.md, motivation_options_after_research.md, and the claim register or original logic map. | Add or rewrite a thesis paragraph that states the primary contribution, subordinates enabling design choices, and previews the evidence sequence. | PASS: later Results and Discussion can be checked against this thesis paragraph. |
| R4 | Method, model, or solution-design unit | Explain why this design is needed, not only what it does, because recipe-style methods do not prove relevance to the motivation. | The method operationalizes the motivation by turning the gap into concrete design choices. | Reference/SOTA examples justify design choices against alternatives and separate necessary mechanisms from implementation detail. | The target scene expects reproducible logic plus rationale, not only architecture labels. | Anchors are claim_register.md or original_logic_map.md, user figures, equations, data descriptions, and method citations. | Place rationale next to each major technical choice: need, choice, alternative, expected effect, and evidence that later evaluates it. | PASS: method unit contains why-this-design logic and does not overclaim beyond available evidence. |
| R5 | Evidence, result, or validation unit | Turn numbers and figures into an argument about the main claim instead of reporting metrics as a list. | Results support the motivation only when each number is interpreted as evidence for the central problem. | Strong examples interpret results immediately after reporting them and connect result order to the promised evidence sequence. | The target scene expects evidence-to-claim continuity and clear independent validation or robustness logic where available. | Anchors are evidence_bank.md, figure_asset_map.md, result tables, dataset descriptions, and cited baselines. | Rewrite result paragraphs as evidence, interpretation, comparison, and limitation; move unsupported claims out or soften them. | PASS: every result claim has a nearby evidence anchor and a stated relevance to the motivation. |
| R6 | Figure, table, heading, or caption unit | Treat visual and heading text as argument-bearing units, not decoration or formatting cleanup. | Captions and headings should help the reader follow how each evidence block supports the motivation. | Reference examples use captions to define the comparison, the measure, and the intended inference without forcing readers to infer the claim alone. | Target venues expect figures/tables to be independently interpretable and consistently labeled. | Anchors are figure_asset_map.md, source_inventory.md, final_paper/main.tex labels, and user-supplied images or tables. | Rewrite headings/captions to state what is being compared, why it matters, and what evidence is safe to infer. | PASS: each caption has a claim boundary and matches the surrounding paragraph. |
| R7 | Limitation, discussion, or recommendation unit | Close by returning to what the evidence does and does not prove, preventing the motivation from becoming an unsupported overclaim. | The motivation is bounded by the evidence, so the final implication is credible rather than inflated. | Reference papers often end by narrowing claims, naming remaining limits, and explaining practical or scientific meaning. | The target scene expects explicit limitations, transferability boundaries, or recommendations depending on journal/report/competition context. | Anchors are claim_register.md, logic_transfer_audit.md, validation evidence, and any missing or weak evidence noted during audit. | Add a bounded conclusion that restates the contribution, names limits, and points to the next step without inventing new data. | PASS: conclusion returns to motivation, cites evidence boundaries, and avoids unverified claims. |
